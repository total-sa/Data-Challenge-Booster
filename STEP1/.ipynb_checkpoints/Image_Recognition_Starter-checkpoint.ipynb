    "It turns out that there is a very efficient way of pulling this off, and it makes advantage of the structure of the information encoded within an image---it is assumed that pixels that are spatially *closer* together will \"cooperate\" on forming a particular feature of interest much more than ones on opposite corners of the image. Also, if a particular (smaller) feature is found to be of great importance when defining an image's label, it will be equally important if this feature was found anywhere within the image, regardless of location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the **convolution** operator. Given a two-dimensional image, $\\bf I$, and a small matrix, $\\bf K$ of size $h \\times w$, (known as a *convolution kernel*), which we assume encodes a way of extracting an interesting image feature, we compute the convolved image, ${\\bf I} * {\\bf K}$, by overlaying the kernel on top of the image in all possible ways, and recording the sum of elementwise products between the image and the kernel:\n",

    "## 3. Convolutional layers and Pooling layers\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution operator forms the fundamental basis of the **convolutional** layer of a CNN. The layer is completely specified by a certain number of kernels, $\\bf \\vec{K}$ (along with additive biases, $\\vec{b}$, per each kernel), and it operates by computing the convolution of the output images of a previous layer with each of those kernels, afterwards adding the biases (one per each output image). Finally, an activation function, $\\sigma$, may be applied to all of the pixels of the output images. Typically, the input to a convolutional layer will have $d$ *channels* (e.g. red/green/blue in the input layer), in which case the kernels are extended to have this number of channels as well, making the final formula of a single output image channel of a convolutional layer (for a kernel ${\\bf K}$ and bias $b$) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{conv}({\\bf I}, {\\bf K})_{xy} = \\sigma\\left(b + \\sum_{i=1}^h \\sum_{j=1}^w \\sum_{k=1}^d {{\\bf K}_{ijk} \\cdot {\\bf I}_{x + i - 1, y + j - 1, k}}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, since all we're doing here is addition and scaling of the input pixels, the kernels may be learned from a given training dataset via *gradient descent*, exactly as the weights of an MLP. In fact, an MLP is perfectly capable of replicating a convolutional layer, but it would require a lot more training time (and data) to learn to approximate that mode of operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's just note that a convolutional operator is in no way restricted to two-dimensionally structured data: in fact, most machine learning frameworks ([Keras included](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/)) will provide you with out-of-the-box layers for 1D and 3D convolutions as well!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that, while a convolutional layer significantly decreases the number of *parameters* compared to a fully connected (FC) layer, it introduces more **hyperparameters**---parameters whose values need to be chosen *before* training starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Namely, the hyperparameters to choose within a single convolutional layer are:\n",
    "- *depth*: how many different kernels (and biases) will be convolved with the output of the previous layer;\n",
    "- *height* and *width* of each kernel;\n",
    "- *stride*: by how much we shift the kernel in each step to compute the next pixel in the result. This specifies the overlap between individual output pixels, and typically it is set to $1$, corresponding to the formula given before. Note that larger strides result in smaller output sizes.\n",
    "- *padding*: note that convolution by any kernel larger than $1\\times 1$ will *decrease* the output image size---it is often desirable to keep sizes the same, in which case the image is sufficiently padded with zeroes at the edges. This is often called *\"same\"* padding, as opposed to *\"valid\"* (no) padding. It is possible to add arbitrary levels of padding, but typically the padding of choice will be either same or valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "As already hinted, convolutions are not typically meant to be the sole operation in a CNN (although there have been promising recent developments on [all-convolutional networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6806v3.pdf)); but rather to extract useful features of an image prior to downsampling it sufficiently to be manageable by an MLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very popular approach to downsampling is a *pooling* layer, which consumes small and (usually) disjoint chunks of the image (typically $2\\times 2$) and aggregates them into a single value. There are several possible schemes for the aggregation---the most popular being **max-pooling**, where the maximum pixel value within each chunk is taken. A diagrammatical illustration of $2\\times 2$ max-pooling is given below.\n",

I did not draw the activation functions here to make the sketch clearer, but do keep in mind that typically after every convolutional or fully connected layer, an activation (e.g. ReLU) will be applied to all of the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the effect of a single $\\mathrm{Conv}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{Pool}$ pass through the image: it reduces height and width of the individual channels in favour of their number, i.e. *depth*.\n",

Within this context, the probabilities correspond to the likelihoods that an input image is a member of a particular class. Minimising the cross-entropy loss has the effect of maximising the model's confidence in the *correct* class, without being concerned for the probabilites for other classes---this makes it a more suitable choice for probabilistic tasks compared to, for example, the squared error loss.\n"

    "## 5. Detour: Overfitting, regularisation and dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "It regards a very important pitfall of machine learning---**overfitting** a model to the training data and we need to introduce a way to properly protect ourselves against it, before going any further. Luckily, there is a very simple technique we can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting corresponds to adapting our model to the training set to such extremes that its generalisation potential (performance on samples outside of the training set) is *severely* limited. In other words, our model might have learned the training set (along with any noise present within it) perfectly, but it has failed to capture the underlying process that generated it. To illustrate, consider a problem of fitting a sine curve, with white additive noise applied to the data points: \n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://perso.mines-paristech.fr/fabien.moutarde/ES_MachineLearning/TP_convNets/plotsin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have a training set (denoted by blue circles) derived from the original sine wave, along with some noise. If we fit a degree-3 polynomial to this data, we get a fairly good approximation to the original curve. Someone might argue that a degree-14 polynomial would do better; indeed, given we have 15 points, such a fit would *perfectly* describe the training data. However, in this case, the additional parameters of the model cause catastrophic results: to cope with the inherent noise of the data, anywhere except in the closest vicinity of the training points, our fit is completely off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks have a large number of parameters, especially in the fully connected layers. Overfitting might often manifest in the following form: if we don't have sufficiently many training examples, a small group of neurons might become responsible for doing most of the processing and other neurons becoming redundant; or in the other extreme, some neurons might actually become detrimental to performance, with several other neurons of their layer ending up doing nothing else but correcting for their errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help our models generalise better in these circumstances, we introduce techniques of *regularisation*: rather than reducing the number of parameters, we impose *constraints* on the model parameters during training to keep them from learning the noise in the training data. The particular method introduced here is **dropout**---a technique that initially might seem like \"dark magic\", but actually helps to eliminate exactly the failure modes described above. Namely, dropout with parameter $p$ will, within a single training iteration, go through all neurons in a particular layer and, with probability $p$, *completely eliminate them from the network throughout the iteration*. This has the effect of forcing the neural network to cope with *failures*, and not to rely on existence of a particular neuron (or set of neurons)---relying more on a *consensus* of several neurons within a layer. This is a very simple technique that works quite well already for combatting overfitting on its own, without introducing further regularisers. An illustration is given below.\n",

Afterwards, the output of the second pooling layer is flattened to 1D (via the `Flatten` layer), and passed through one or two fully connected (`Dense`) layers.
